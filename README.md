# News Summary challenge

This app grabs headlines relating to Dominic Cummings, prime minister Boris Johnson's former advisor, from the Guardian newspaper API and displays them on a page. Clicking on a headline will show the article.

### Technologies

This is a single page web app. I wrote the code in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML. As per the [instructions of this challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/news-summary-challenge), I did not use any libraries or frameworks. Instead I used a test framework that I wrote earlier in the week for [this notes app](https://github.com/kabligh/notes-app).

### Serving the app

I used [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) to serve the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.

## User Stories

The app is based on the following user stories:

```
As a busy politician

So I know what he is doing
```

```
